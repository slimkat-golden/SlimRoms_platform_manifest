Welcome to slimkat-golden
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with SlimKat, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).


To initialize your local repository using the SlimKat trees (CAF not supported!), use this command:

	repo init -u git://github.com/slimkat-golden/platform_manifest.git -b kk4.4


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
